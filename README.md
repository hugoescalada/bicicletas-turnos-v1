# Bicicletas Turnos Premium

A modern, premium bicycle service booking application.

## Getting Started

1. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

2. Run the development server:
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```

## Features

- **Premium UI**: Glassmorphism design, smooth animations (Framer Motion).
- **Booking Flow**: Multi-step wizard (Service -> Date -> Time -> Details).
- **Local Persistence**: Data is saved to LocalStorage.

## Tech Stack

- React + Vite
- TailwindCSS (via plain CSS variables for this specific implementation as requested, though CSS Modules/Styled Components can be adopted)
  *Note: The current implementation uses Vanilla CSS variables in `index.css` for the design system as per the prompt's preference for "Vanilla CSS" over Tailwind unless requested. The project structure supports standard CSS imports.*
- Framer Motion for animations.
- React Router for navigation.
